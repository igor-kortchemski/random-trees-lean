# Regularly varying sequences

This directory is a real-analysis toolbox about a monotone sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ`,
positive at every `n ≥ 1`, that is regularly varying of an index `ρ`.
For the scalar stable normalizers, the relevant index is `ρ = 1/α ∈ [1/2, 1)`.

The sequential form of regular variation used here is

  `a ⌊c n⌋ / a n → c ^ ρ` for every `c > 0`.
