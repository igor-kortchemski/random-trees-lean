# The Vervaat image of the constructed Brownian bridge

The anchored Brownian bridge gives a measurable continuous loop for every outcome on the
constructed source probability space. Applying the deterministic Vervaat transformation gives
an actual probability law on nonnegative continuous paths with zero endpoints.

The rooted measured tree law is the genuine image under coding by twice this path. Its root
is represented by time zero, and its mass is the existing Lebesgue pushforward from the coding
construction. The normalization is therefore explicitly `T_(2e)`.

These are laws of the constructed Vervaat path and its coded tree. Almost-sure uniqueness of
the bridge minimizer, strict interior positivity, and identification with the standard Brownian
excursion and classical Brownian CRT laws are separate, unproved probabilistic statements.
