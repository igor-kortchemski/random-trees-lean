# Forgetting the measure contracts GHP to GH

Every measured ambient cost contains the ordinary Hausdorff cost of the same
isometric embeddings. Thus the exact Gromov--Hausdorff distance is bounded
by the exact measured infimum. In particular zero GHP distance forces a
whole-space isometry; preservation of the measure is a further obligation.
